# UoM-Ground-Station

**Update: The work on this branch has been complete**

This is the work of:   
**James Coleman**   
**Ildem Baymaz**   
**Jazib Imran**   

This branch is to re-order the screen.py script. Right now the screen runs a script that handles one screen but ideally it should have a menu that can change between different screens.
This is something that will take some work and iteration on so it is done on another branch. This allows work to continue as normal on the main branch.
